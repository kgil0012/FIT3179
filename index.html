				<p>
				Today's leading countries of the world are, INDIA, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, FRANCE,UNITED KINGDOM and RUSSIA.
				<br> <br> These are the top leading countries in terms of their GDP individually over the past years 
				and also there growth over the past several years. 
				<br> <br> Looking towards are left, we can see that over the past 20 years, United Kingdom's GDP was on rise 
				but dropped down drastically from the year 2011 and went back to the same economy as it was in 1998.
				<br> From this, we can 
				clearly see that India's GDP is on the drastic rise from late 1990's crossing many countries.
				<br> <br> Towards the left, this is the 60% of the world economy and thesee are the countries which conttribute to it.
				Despite everything, still the United Kingdom contributes the most to this, followed by Japan, India and Germany.

				The first row shows us the relation between the GDP and various sectors of our society from which ever	y citizen of a country is 
				affected.
				<br> We can clearly see that higher the GDP higher are the Expenditures which contribute to well being of citizens from education to
				health expenditure. 
				<br> Higher the Inflation Rate affects these expenditures oppositely as the expenditures decrease as the countries are trying to hold
				GDP.
				<br> But as the GDP drops more is the unemployment of the citizens, but this is not the only factor on which unemployment depends. GDP
				per capita and Inflation also plays role.
